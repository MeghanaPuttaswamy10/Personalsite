    content: |-
      I am a Machine learning engineer with a great love and passion for Artificial Intelligence. To pursue my interest, I decided to embark on the academic journey of completing Master degree in the United Kingdom. I am a recent graduate of Masters in data science and analytics from University of Leeds. I also bring to the table a strong understanding of network security as I worked in the network security domain at one of the biggest networking company. 
      
      Puzzles have always been something I've loved since I was small. That's how I view large data sets: as a single, complex puzzle that needs to be solved. The challenge for me is identifying patterns that nobody else notices.
